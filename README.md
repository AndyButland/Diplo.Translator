# Diplo.Translator

This is package for **Umbraco 10** CMS that adds a `Translate` option to the Umbraco **Dictionary** within the **Translation** tree. This option can be used to automatically translate all the empty dictionary items in the tree from the default language using an AI-based translation service. By default this is [Microsoft Translator](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/translator/). In future other providers may be supported.
